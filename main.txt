- set up SSH on Windows
	- watching: https://dev.to/bdbch/setting-up-ssh-and-git-on-windows-10-2khk
	- *"SSH should be preinstalled on new Windows 10 machines"*
	- `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "edward@tanguay.info"`
		- *"everybody can have as many private keys as they want"*
		- no passphrase
		- private key is saved in `C:\Users\ADMIN\.ssh\id_rsa2`
		- public key is inM `C:\Users\ADMIN\.ssh\id_rsa2.pub`
		- went to: https://github.com/settings/keys
			- copied in public key, called it "main key windows"
		- `git clone git@github.com:edwardtanguay/onespace.git onespace_copy`
			- got error: 
				--------------------------------
				Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '140.82.121.4' to the list of known hosts.
				git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
				fatal: Could not read from remote repository.  
				--------------------------------
		- switching id_rsa2 to id_rsa
			- trying again: `git clone git@github.com:edwardtanguay/onespace.git onespace_copy`
				- was able to clone repository
				- making change and committing
					- that works as well
- doing on Ubuntu same way with all defaults
